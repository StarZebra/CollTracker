command /ts

## Where are the new collections?
To fix outdated collections do '/cttryfetchcollections'
Keep in mind I cant change the dropdown in the config to automatically account for new updates so if theres a collection missing (that isnt gemstones) let me know and ill update asap

In the mean time you can still track the new collection by using the command '/ts startset [collection]'

## HOW TO USE STASH FEATURE:
1. Start a tracking session, (either '/ts startset [collection]' or let sack message automatically start session)
2. Do /viewstash material and close it
3. Do some mining
4. Repeat steps 2-3 to get correct rates on the tracker (dont have to keep opening, if you dont want live rate updates)

# any issues report to dc @astoned
